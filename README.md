# Regression Methods Used:

**Random Forest Regressor** is a meta-estimator that fits a set of classification decision trees to different subsamples of a dataset, 
uses averaging to improve prediction accuracy, and controls overfitting. ... the number of trees in the forest.

# What is the difference between a random forest classifier and a regressor? 
 Random forest classifiers works with data that has individual labels, or data that is well known as a class. **Example** Patients may or may not have cancer, 
 and people may or may not be eligible for a loan. 
 Random forest regressors have numeric or continuous output and works with data that cannot be defined in a class.
